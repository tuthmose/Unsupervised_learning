# Unsupervised Learning

This repo includes algorithms related to:

- Clustering
- Cluster validation (internal / external)
- Combinatorial optimizatio

Algorithms included were selected because of:

- they were not present at the time in scikit-learn or extras (but perhaps they are now) e. g. Density Peaks or SNN
- self teaching
